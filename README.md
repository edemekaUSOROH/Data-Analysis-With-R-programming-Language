# Flight Arrival Delay Prediction - LAX to JFK

## Project Overview
This end-to-end data analysis project aims to predict the arrival delay time of flights from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Using an airline dataset, the project includes data acquisition via web scraping, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, and refinement to build a robust predictive model.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Data collected by web scraping relevant flight details.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and pre-processing the dataset for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding patterns, correlations, and distributions in the dataset.
4. **Model Development**: Implementing predictive models to forecast arrival delay.
5. **Model Evaluation and Refinement**: Evaluating model performance and refining to improve accuracy.
