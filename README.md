### README.md - Data Analysis Project on Airline Arrival Delay Prediction

Welcome to my data analysis project repository! Here, you'll find Jupyter notebooks documenting my exploration, analysis, and modeling efforts on predicting arrival delay times for airline carriers using R.

#### Project Overview
This project focuses on:
- **Data Acquisition**: Gathering airline carrier dataset for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for modeling.
- **Model Development**: Building predictive models using various techniques in R.
- **Model Evaluation and Refinement**: Assessing model performance and optimizing for accuracy.

#### Repository Structure
- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks detailing each phase of the analysis.
- **Datasets**: Includes the dataset used in the project.
- **Reports**: Summaries and findings from the analysis process.

#### Tools and Techniques Used
- **Programming**: R for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
- **Libraries**: Utilized packages such as `tidyverse`, `caret`, and `ggplot2` for analysis.
- **Modeling**: Employed regression and possibly machine learning algorithms for prediction.

#### Key Insights
- Insights and discoveries from the data.
- Performance metrics of developed models.
